2. (30 pts) Describe the Redis data structures that you are going to use to implement the functionalities you described in the previous point. (example To implement the most viewed products I will use a Redis sorted set with key "mostViewed:userId", product ids as the values and a score of the number of views of the product.). You can use/describe more than one data structure, you will need to implement at least one.
